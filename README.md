- 👋 Hi, I’m @C-Colliver
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a hell of a lot of things.  Almost none of which make money.  A fair amount of them are edible.  Or drinkable.  But have little value in this tockneologically consumptive world.  For example, can you identify Agaricus campestris in your neighborhood park?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... to be even more patient with all things technology.  Why change an action just because you changed the font size on the phone?  Dear Dog some of us have only gained poor eyesight with age.  Oh Henry yes, what am I learning? I could claim to be learning more about Python but that would be a stretch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... absolutely nothing.  I am not a real programmer and would barely consider myself a hack.  Yes I can read some code in some languages and even wrench out a bit.  However, to pin the moniker of coder, programmer, developer upon my "skils list" would be a lie.  So wouldn't expect anyone to actually want to "collaborate" in that respect.  Within Specific Topics, I am danm good at nailing down 95% of a feature's use cases and then asking how these fit into a system.  FWIW.
- 📫 How to reach me ... ?  This is a fun item isn't it.  Reach in this context is an action of physical extension of a body part from one individual attempting to touch another.  I would rather it say "contact me" and not be reached.  Please send all postal correspondence to Madison River Brewing, Gelbrade, MT.  
- 😄 Pronouns: ... Yes.  These are useful once all parties have reached consensus as to their accepted/desired gender.  I am hopelessly heterosecular and would rather just know your first name and whether or not you identify as being a vaginated biped, a dork possessing biped, or another form of hominid. Your sectxuaulity is yers.  If you claim to be a Dog I will be forced to ask my own furrbuddy to schniff yerr butt to verify the veracity of your claim.  I am unable to communicate with all other life forms therefore will contest such claims made by such claimants as false and demeaning.    Selah.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Did you realize that Ned's Atomic Dustbin is the greatest band to ever come from Scotland?  Thank You KEXP!  Now go look up "famous people from Stourbridge"... and then the KEXP PSA.  "Never believe all you read on the interwebs." A. Lincoln
